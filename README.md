# Swap-Shop
A swap shop is a community initiative where individuals donate unwanted items for free, often during transitions like moving out or decluttering. Rather than trashing these items, donors share them with others, promoting sustainability and minimizing waste. The project idea aims to develop a web application exclusively for LSU.
